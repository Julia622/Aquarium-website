<h2 style="margin-left: 550px;">Important aspects of salt water:</h2>

<div id="text5">
<p>This is one of the biggest reasons why I find it more complex to take care of marine aquariums.
   In seawater, we practically have an entire periodic table. So it is to be expected that all of the 
   many dozens of chemical elements present in the ocean are present in your saltwater aquarium, as they 
   are necessary for the good health of the organisms that live there. And how to ensure that all these
   elements are present? It is possible to buy synthetic salt and just mix it, in the correct concentration, 
   with fresh water (obviously, a quality salt that provides all the elements).</p>

   
<p style="margin-bottom: 150px;">But, look, it can't be just any freshwater. Using tap water or even
   mineral water ends up interfering with the concentration of each element present, and that is not 
   what we want. You need to use water that has already passed through a deionizing or reverse osmosis 
   filter. From time to time, it is necessary to perform a partial water change (the amount and frequency 
   may vary from aquarium to aquarium), where part of the water is removed and replaced with new salt water. 
   But, in addition to the partial exchange – which is done in freshwater aquariums as well – it is necessary 
   to replace the water that evaporates in marine aquariums. Only the water evaporates, the salts remain in the 
   water inside the aquarium. Therefore, if there is no addition of freshwater (reverse osmosis or deionized), 
   the concentration of salts will be very high, harming living beings.</p>
