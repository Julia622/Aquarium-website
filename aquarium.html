<h2>Reef Aquarium</h2>
<p>Probably the most popular type of marine aquarium. Its purpose is to keep fish and corals in harmony, 
   so it is essential that there is no type of fish that eats coral.</p>

<h2>Fish Only Aquarium</h2>
<p>As its name suggests, it is a type of marine aquarium populated only by fish. Most of these fish feed on
   pagurus, shrimp, corals, anemones, and other invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Coral Aquarium</h2>
<p>Perfect for bringing a multitude of shapes and beautiful colors to any environment, the coral aquarium does 
   not have fish. Some may possess only one or the other so-called pest controller, a role played by tang or wrasse.</p>
