<h2 style="margin-left: 730px;">Sump</h2>
<div id="text3">
<p>Unlike how it is used in freshwater aquariums, the sump is not suitable for placing biological media
   (we will talk about this in the filtration topic), but rather for placing equipment. A secondary function
   of the sump is to increase the volume of water in the aquarium, thus increasing nutrient dissolution and 
   thermal stability. We recommend making your aquarium sump as large as possible. It is not necessary to make 
   partitions, just a bubble breaker right before repressing. The larger the space available, the easier it is to 
   accommodate equipment and move it when necessary. Some people like to make refuges in the sump to breed 
   microorganisms and other animals and even to place some fish if necessary. A simple refuge to make is just 
   live rocks and puddle shrimp. The larvae of these shrimp will be carried by the current and will feed fish, 
   corals and other animals in the aquarium.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left: 740px;">Lighting</h2>
<div id="text3l">
<p>This part is extremely important for coral aquariums and of much lesser importance in an aquarium with just fish.
   Reef aquariums require better quality light than aquariums with just fish. The main types of lamps
   used in aquariums are: HQIs, LEDs, and Tubular (T5 or T8). There are several brands with different 
   color temperatures, effects and facilities. It is the lighting that will give color to the aquarium.
   With adequate and quality lighting, animals look more beautiful and healthier. To choose any lamp we
   recommend a color temperature of 5500K. This color temperature reduces the incidence of algae in the
   aquarium and has a white and clean appearance. If you prefer a bluer color, you should use a lamp with 
   a higher color temperature. You can also mix different color temperatures to get the look you want in
   the aquarium.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left: 660px;">Water Quality Tests</h2>
<p>Something essential is to monitor water quality through tests, just like in freshwater aquariums, but more parameters
   need to be analyzed. Here are some that should be measured to monitor water quality: Calcium,  Magnesium,  
    Alkaline reserve (kH),  pH,  Ammonia, nitrite and nitrate,  Phosphate,  Salinity. Well, briefly speaking,
    these are some important aspects to consider when having a saltwater aquarium, apart from many others that 
    I haven't even mentioned (such as issues regarding the substrate and rocks). I believe you can see how 
    costly and laborious it really is, which requires dedication and investment. But if you're really interested,
    go for it, because marine aquariums are truly fascinating!</p>


<h2 style="margin-left: 700px;">The Aquarius</h2>
<p>In all these years of setting up and maintaining marine aquariums we have seen that aquariums with at least 200 liters 
   tend to perform better over the years than smaller aquariums. This is mainly due to nutrient dissolution capacity and 
   thermal stability.Nutrient dissolution is the ability to dilute contaminants to non-toxic concentrations. If an aquarium 
   with 50 liters of water has 4 ppm of ammonia (a high value for marine aquariums), in a marine aquarium with 500 liters of water the 
   same amount of ammonia represents a concentration of 0.4ppm, which is not harmful to animals. Thermal stability is the
   ability to maintain the current temperature and not heat up or cool down quickly according to the ambient temperature.
   The larger the volume of water in the aquarium, the more difficult it is to heat or cool it. We recommend that the
   aquarium is no more than 60cm high. This is so that you can catch anything that falls into the aquarium with your 
   hand and the lower the height, the better the light penetration into the water. It's really bad to handle very tall 
   aquariums, it's uncomfortable and sometimes causes problems. For a beginner we recommend an aquarium measuring 100cm 
   x 40cm x 50cm high. This aquarium has 200 gross liters and a very pleasant shape. With this size it is possible to have 
   any type of coral and is comfortable for fish up to 15cm. For a 200 liter aquarium we recommend a fauna for beginners of
   up to 4 fish only. A reduced fauna helps keep contaminant levels (ammonia, phosphate, etc.) low. Over time and with experience 
   gained, the aquarist can add a few more fish compatible with the size of the aquarium and type of aquarium.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left: 730px;">Filtering</h2>
<p>The skimmer is by far the main filtration equipment
   in the marine aquarium. The skimmer is not used in freshwater aquariums because it doesn't work in fresh water. If it worked,
   everyone would use it because it is cheaper and simpler than filters with biological media. The skimmer is more efficient
   than biological media for the simple fact that it removes organic matter more easily than biological media. While biological
   media transform organic matter little by little into less harmful substances, sump removes them from the system all at once
   and beforehand. Biological media ends up in excessive accumulation of nitrate and phosphate in the aquarium, which is not good.
   We do not recommend the use of biological media with the skimmer, in most aquariums it is not necessary. If you use a skimmer 
   and biological media together, the biological media slightly interferes with the skimmer's functioning. The skimmer is very 
   easy to remove proteins, bacteria and organic carbon, but it has a low affinity for ammonia and even less for nitrite, 
   nitrate and phosphate. From this point of view, it is better to prevent proteins from being broken down into ammonia and 
   let the skimmer remove it more easily. As the skimmer has a low affinity for nitrite, nitrate and phosphate, additional 
   filtration becomes necessary over time. For this we recommend using a sulfur reactor or a biopellet reactor. There are 
   people who like to use an algae filter, but we don't recommend it, it's a type of filter that can go very wrong. We see no 
   fundamental need for chemical filtration with activated carbon or purigen. We do not use any type of chemical filtration in 
   our marine aquarium. Activated carbon has a good affinity with iodine, so for our aquarium that focuses on corals it is not 
   advantageous. There are very nice aquariums out there using charcoal and/or purigen, but it is not absolutely necessary. 
   These materials can be used very successfully in cases of ammonia peaks or water contamination by a toxin.</p>
