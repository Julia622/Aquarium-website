   Marine care is nothing more than a little piece of the sea inside your home. This hobby that decorates and brightens environments
   requires patience, dedication and for laypeople, good guidance from an aquarist. In addition to providing a more natural environment,
   a diversity of fish and coral species delights people of all ages. In fact, it's more than a hobby. It's a lifestyle</p>

<p style="height: 100px;">
   Saltwater aquariums are often highly desired by aquarists, mainly due to their beautiful appearance.
   Everyone must agree that those colorful fish and corals make any room or room more beautiful.
   However, it doesn't seem like a good idea to have a marine aquarium if you only intend to decorate your home.</p>

<p style="height: 100px;">
   If I had to use just one word to describe saltwater aquariums it would be: complexity.
   Something essential is to guarantee the stability of this ecosystem, which is not a simple task,
   as it is necessary to think about and take care of many aspects.</p>

<p style="height: 120px;">
   In general, they are more laborious and expensive than freshwater ones, which I usually recommend for beginner aquarists.
   In the beginning, it is common to make mistakes, and mariners are less tolerant of these mistakes.
   Therefore, I also emphasize that, if your goal is just to decorate the living room in your home,
   it is worth buying a beautiful painting of the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 150px;">
   But if you are really willing to deal with all the complexity involved in a marine aquarium (and invest the necessary money),
   here are some very important tips that you need to know!</p>
